# Bunsen

Bunsen is a TODO list manager. Yes another one. None of the existing Todo Managers combine all the features I like so I gave up and decided to write my own.


## Getting Started

To get started with Bunsen, you must have Perl installed with Carton. If you don't know what those are, or how to find out, Bunsen really isn't ready for you yet, maybe one day it will be.

To install Bunsen and get it running do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/perigrin/Bunsen.git
    cd Bunsen
    carton install
    carton exec plackup

Once that is done you should have Bunsen running at `http://localhost:5000`.
